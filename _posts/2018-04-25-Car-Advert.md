    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>At the start of the lesson we went to our places and signed in to our computers and then Mr Keen said to come to the front of the classroom where he would show us things on his computer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>In the lesson we watched a short advert which was about a Kia car and what its target market was for. We also discussed why the animals and strong men were in it. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes I did because I joined in with the conversation and put my hand up to explain some good ideas of how they did this and that and why. I also enjoyed becoming part of the debate of the car advert because it enabled me to express my views on which others might have a different answer. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered when I put my hand up to discuss my thoughts of the car advert even though some people might say I am wrong. So that I could have a different say I tried to think of other things to say about the advert that no one has said before. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned a lot in class because I put my hand up a lot of the times and try to ask inquisitive and controversial  questions that gets everyone thinking in my form as well as Mr Keen.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>In class I am independant and think of my own questions to ask Mr Keen and the class in general about the thing that we were learning about in class which in this case was the Kia advert that we were talking about. I was also independant when we were thinking of the target market for the advert.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I think in this lesson I was very interactive and paying attention to everyone who wanted to be heard. I think I let people have their say and worked hard to think of good and relevant questions in class about the car and the advert behind it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged fully in this lesson as I answered lots of questions that had good content, I tried to not get distracted and fiddle with things and I made eye contact with the people who were speaking in the room at the time. Throughout the lesson I sat in my chair looking at the board and watching what Mr Keen was telling us about the advert. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time the changes that I need to make to improve my learning are to share more opinions and not talk to people when I shouldn't be because our whole class was sent outside because of the noise levels in class.</td>
