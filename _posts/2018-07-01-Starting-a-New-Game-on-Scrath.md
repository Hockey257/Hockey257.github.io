    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>At the start of the lesson we were told that Mr Keen wasn't here so we had a cover teacher instead.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Our target for this lesson was to create start another game on scratch. Firstly for ten minutes approximately we played other people’s games so that we could get inspiration. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>In the lesson I think I did reach my target because I started to think of cool ideas at the start of the lesson and then I decided to create a game that includes a helicopter that hovers at the top of the screen going left and right.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>In this lesson because Mr Keen wasn't here we had to start a scratch game by ourselves. This took a bit of perseverance because I didn’t place the right code in at the start to make my helicopter go left and right but after some thinking a sorted it out and then the helicopter was doing the commands that I wanted it to do.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>This lesson was very quiet because everyone was focusing on their scratch game so not many people including me asked questions because our task was independant. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>In this lesson our task which was to start off our own scratch games was very independant because Mr Keen wasn’t there to help you. This meant that I had to work things out by myself. In the end I think I didn’t need Mr Keen to help me because I tried hard to put things right if they were wrong and I had made the basics of my game in the space of one hour.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I think in this lesson I was very independant with my work and I focused on trying to make the start of my game look as good as I could in the space of an hour. At the start of the lesson I didn’t spend to much time looking for ideas for my game so I had more time to make the start of it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>This week I used engagement because when I was making my game I had to look at the screen a lot of the time. I also looked at our cover teacher and followed the instructions that he gave us.</td>
