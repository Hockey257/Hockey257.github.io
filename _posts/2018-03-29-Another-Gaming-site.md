  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Our starting point as usual was to sign into our computers and face the board to show that we were ready to start the lesson. Then Mr Keen introduced us to another new website for young programmers. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Our target for this lesson was to complete a one hour of code game on .org and make sure we save the certificate that you get when you complete it for proof. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes I did reach my target in this lesson because I successfully completed two games. The first one that I tried out was Minecraft and after I had completed that I moved onto Flappy Bird which was a little trickier but it was good fun. I also started a bit of the Star Wars game but I didn't finish all of it in the time I was given for this lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>When I was sitting on my chair in the classroom, I sometimes didn't know what the code was straight away for completing the level and it was hard not to ask my friend who was sitting next to me who had already done that particular stage. So I had to persevere in this lesson and try to do the code myself which would be the harder option but it would make me a better programmer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned people who were sitting next to me if they had finished a level of the game I was on. If so then I would ask them (if I was really struggling) if they could tell me a little hint in how to complete it but not do it for me because then I wouldn’t be doing it myself. At some points in the stages of code for making the yellow bird fly in Flappy Bird I would sometimes think to myself if I was doing the right code.

    <td>When I was in the classroom I was focusing on only my computer and making sure I don’t get distracted by the other people in my class who are talking when they shouldn’t be. In Minecraft there was a little button which said hint on it but I wanted to do it on my own without any help so I did all the levels without pressing the hint button and got given my certificate.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>In this lesson I thought I got on really well and went through the levels at a steady pace. When I was stuck on a question I always tried to think of all the ways of doing it before someone else told me the answer. I like computing when I can do the task I am given and I also like it when I can’t do it at first but then after a while of thinking I can and that’s what happened this lesson when I was on flappy bird when I couldn’t make the bird make bigger flaps.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I thought I made very good eye-contact with Mr Keen this enabled me to fully understand what he was saying to the class. I listened in the lesson to what Mr Keen and my friends had to say. I put my hand up often to answer questions even though I am not fully sure of saying the right answer. I also tried helping people by encouraging them but not giving them much information because then I would be doing the work for them.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I could have tried not to get distracted by my friends talking in the classroom making a loud noise and carried on working on the level I was on. I could have been a bit quicker as I worked through the games that were displayed because I only finished two and I wanted to explore more games that you could pick to code on the website. My learning would have also gone much better if I chose harder games to code so it could really make me think and prove to be a challenge.</td>
