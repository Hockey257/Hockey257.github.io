  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>My starting point was to go to scratch and get a bit more done like make the laser disappear. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Make our blogs look better and professional.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Finally I did make the laser disappear but sadly I didn't save it so I have lost all my progress. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>In class I did persevere because at first I didn't know how to make the laser disappear but with some common sense I figured it out by playing around with it. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned myself to get the answer for example I didn’t know how to make the space aliens move but then Mr Keen told us about the clown button and that’s what made me progress with my work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>In class when Mr Keen was inspecting everybody’s  work I tried not to put my hand up for him to come and help me because there is no point someone just telling you the answer because you don’t learn anything.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I am reflecting now because I should have saved my work in the first place however I didn’t that is how I lost my work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I focused hard to try and fit the puzzle pieces to my game so I looked at my computer, not looking at anyone else.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In my learning in Computer Science so far through Challoner’s it has been a struggle because I have learnt that there isn’t just one answer so sometimes I could just think again and you never know it could be right.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For future tasks I need to make sure I save my work otherwise I won’t get anywhere also I need to have more confidence so I can do things out of my comfort zone. </td>
