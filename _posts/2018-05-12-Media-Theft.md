<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>As usual Mr Keen told us to stand behind our chairs and wait to start the lesson. Then when he had welcomed everyone in the room he told us to take a seat and sign in to our computers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Our topic over a few weeks is media so this lesson we were still focusing on media. This lesson our target was to get an understanding of streaming videos and listening to music and about how people can illegally copyright things.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes I did get a good understanding of the media used around the world and how people stream music and youtube videos. It is illegal to copy a video and send it to someone else or post it again. That would be stealing someone's music.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>In this lesson we did some activities so it was hard to show my learning habits but nevertheless I did answer some interesting questions about media and how it works. Even if I was not sure of what the answer could be I put my hand up because I want to know what the right answer is.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>In the lesson as I have said, I answered questions to make me and all the other people in the room think. I didn't shout out the answer and I always put my hand up.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>In class we played a game about reality. This is where Mr Keen would ask the class questions and the room was split in half meaning that one side was agree and disagree. When he was asking the questions I didn’t go with the crowd, I went with what I believed was the right decision.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I think this lesson was particularly fun because we could actually get involved a lot more than just sitting at the front of the classroom listening to what Mr Keen had to say about whatever we were learning about. I think this lesson I contributed well and thought of my own ideas and questions. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>This lesson was an active lesson so as a class we could all get involved and talk about the situations about the ways that people can copyright which is illegal. I always payed attention to the the questions that Mr Keen read out and I focused hard on what I should question and answer.</td>

    <td>In my learning I could have made more options.</td>

    <td>To make more options I could think of more ideas to ask next time in class.</td>
