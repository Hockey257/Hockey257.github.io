**Computer Games Homework**

The games I have played are donkey kong, space invaders and pacman they are all  very straight forward. There is always a sense of winning and a start button. You can move right and left and the character does a turn.

They all have sprites for example donkey kong has mario as a sprite.

All these computer games have a 'bady' and if you get ‘killed’ by this ‘bady’ you will have to start all over again - very simple but effective. Space Vaders have levels if you complete level one.

Most of these games all have the up, down, left and right buttons.

Space Vaders is a fun but very simple game. It tells you your score in the top right hand side of the screen and the aim of the game is to end all of the creatures, each have different points, before they end you.

When making a game you have to think, what is the aim of the game and how is it going to capture the person's attention. 

The variables are when you push the up,down,left,right button it turns…
