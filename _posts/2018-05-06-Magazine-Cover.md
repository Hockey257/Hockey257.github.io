  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>At the start of the lesson we went to our places and signed in to our computers and then Mr Keen said to come to the front of the classroom where he would show us things on his computer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Our target for this lesson was to get an overall understanding of magazine covers. We looked at a video of a lady lying down on the floor. At the start she looked like a normal person but then they made alterations with her body. They made her arms and legs longer and they made her legs thinner for the picture. We were talking about how this isn't a real person and how it influences girls her age to look as pretty as pretty as her.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I think I did reach my target of understanding magazine covers because thanks to that video I now know if I do see a magazine cover, they will have spent so much time putting the make up on the person (who is on the magazine cover) and crop her body parts so that she looks appealing. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered this lesson by putting up my hand to ask questions about this video which shows how magazine covers work. Even if I didn't know what the right question was I would still have a go at answering the question.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>As I have already said I asked lots of questions about the video and I always put my hand up so Mr Keen knows I have engaged with the class.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>In class I am independant and think of my own questions to ask Mr Keen and the rest of the class in general about the video that we were learning and discussing about in class. I was also independant when we were thinking of what impression it gives to girls.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I think in that lesson I answered some good questions which made Mr Keen think and the rest of the class think as well as myself. I enjoyed hearing other people's views about it and listening to what Mr Keen had to say about it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Throughout the whole lesson I was looking either at the video which was the main focus in this lesson, my classmates which were saying their views on the video and the lady who was lying on the floor or Mr Keen.</td>
