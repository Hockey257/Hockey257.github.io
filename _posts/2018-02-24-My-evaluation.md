  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>My starting point was way back in December where I got told I had to make a game on Scratch. I thought that I would never be able to make a good game but in the end I found my feet and I started to piece together a good game to please Mr Keen.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for the end of half term.</td>
    <td>My target was to finish my car game which is called Turbo Boost  before the end of half term where Mr Keen would start collecting our work. My target was to be creative and produce a great game that works and people will enjoy playing. I also had to make sure I had used some good coding skills on Scratch to get good marks when Mr Keen marks them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes I did reach my overall target because I made a very successful game which I had put a lot of effort and commitment into. Also when people played my game they seemed to like the idea of it and all the sprites and backdrops that I coded to make my game interesting and fun to play.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>When I was in the classroom on my computer, I sometimes got into a muddle with my code on my game and it was always tricky to not ask Mr Keen for help because otherwise 'Mr Keen would be doing the work for me'. So I now have learnt that you have to persevere to succeed in your work and not let other people do it for you. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td> When people were evaluating each other's work and playing their games     
 I questioned people about how to improve my game, for instance I         
 received some feedback saying that my game was a bit too hard so in 
 order to make it easier I could make the opponent car speed variable 
 slower.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>In Mr Keen’s lessons I always focus on my work and persevere in trying to make my game by myself. I made all the sprites and variables by myself and backdrops even though I found it difficult. I had problems with my cars going around the track because the laps kept on changing when the cars didn’t go across the finishing line but finally I had worked out why and then it worked out fine and then I was happy because my game was starting to look quite good.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Throughout the whole six weeks of producing our games every lesson I think ‘what can I do next week to make my game better and how I can achieve that’ which helps me to think positively in the next lesson and get going on what I want to change or add to my game to improve it. After this intense time of making my game finally when I finished I had to gather information from other people in my class about my game. Some of the improvements they suggested is that I could have made Turbo Boost a two player game which would have made it more competitive and addictive to play with your friends. Also I have reflected over every blog that I have done to describe my thoughts in more detail and write more about my day I had in IT.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>When Mr Keen has spoken to us as a class about our games I am always watching him and seeing what he does so I know what to do when he sends us back to our seats to do the coding that he has just showed us.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your six weeks of making your game?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In the six weeks of making my game I worked really hard and focused in what my task was that Mr Keen had set me to do. I always work really hard in lessons trying to show Mr Keen my full ability on Scratch. What could have gone better in my six weeks of trying hard, is that I could have made more of an effort of looking for game styles that I could have picked from. I also received another improvement that I could have made more cars to choose from on the choose car sprite for instance: a purple car, a red car, an orange car, a green car, a pink car and a light blue car.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I like to challenge myself so every week we had  IT I used to always think what I could I add to Turbo Boost to make it more addictive and fun. In my six weeks I have learnt a lot of code and figured my way around Scratch which is a good achievement seeing that I have never used Scratch before in my old school. Next time I get given the task to make a game on Scratch I will look at harder games to make and include more sprites and backdrops to challenge myself even more. I could also improve on my originality of my game because although people have said it is really good and fun, there are lots of car games that other people have made as well. Over these weeks I thoroughly enjoyed making my game and now I am looking forward to the next one that I am going to make. </td>
