    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>'Get down to work' is what Mr Keen would say so as soon as we logged in our Scratch account we had to start making a bit more of our games on Scratch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Our target for this lesson was to get a bit more of our Scratch game done.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes I have reached my target because I made a variable called ‘laps’ which counted the laps of the race car going round the track.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered that lesson because at first my laps wouldn't work but after a good bit of concentration and effort I tried to make the laps change when the race car crosses the finish line.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked Felix who was sitting near to me how the car laps would change when it crossed the finish line and then I worked out that the finish line could be a different colour to white so I could say when touching colour… change laps by 1.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked out myself that the finish line had to be a different colour to the track otherwise it would be a struggle to come up with another idea to get the laps to work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected on my work that after looking and playing the game I could make the traffic car a lot slower.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I saw that I needed to make a new variable which was make a quarter lap so that people couldn’t cheat and go over the finish line five times and get a ridiculously good time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have not got distracted by the person who was sitting next to me because there computer wasn’t working and had to move computer. My spacebar on my computer wasn’t working very well so I could have changed computer which would have helped me spead up with the typing.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could change my game to make it more ambitious - make it so it does not have a timer instead make it so it is racing against the computer. I might make another sprite in my game which could be another car you can choose from to play the game. </td>
