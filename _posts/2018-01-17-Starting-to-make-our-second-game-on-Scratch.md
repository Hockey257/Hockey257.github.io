    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>If we hadn't finished your planning we had to finish the sheet to our new game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To start a part of your new game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes because I have made the track and I have made the car move round it (right, left, down and up) without making it glide. I have also used a custom block called Move car.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered when the grass in my game didn't slow the car down but when I kept trying with a little help of Mr Keen I finally did what I wanted the car to do.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked myself what I was doing with the programing blocks and that helped me realize what I had done.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I made my own racing track not copying an image from google where it was pre-made.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected on my work because at first I had a side on view of a car but I didn’t realize that I needed a birds-eye view of the car otherwise it would look a bit strange as it turned around the corners but then I saw it and changed it so it looked a bit more realistic.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was looking (even though I didn’t need a scroll in my game) in what Mr Keen did to make the the game scroll down incase I wanted to do that in the future.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have experimented more in how to make the car slow down when it was in the grass without Mr Keen helping me. I could have made a variable 'car speed’ without Mr Keen telling me to. So I could have been more independant with my work.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I should have been more independant and I could have been more creative with my ideas and give myself a harder target.</td>
