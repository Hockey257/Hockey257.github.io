    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>As usual we got told by Mr Keen to sit down in our normal places and sign into our computer. Then he told the class to gather round his chair so we know what to do when he sends us of again. He went on google classroom and sent a link to the class about a word glossary so our task for the lesson was to get into groups of fours and make a powerpoint on all the words he had set us. But we weren't allowed to copy and paste.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Our target for this lesson was to have a successful glossary in powerpoint which would tell you what each words mean. We were going to do this by reading information in more than one website and then putting the definition into our own words.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>As a group we reached our target because we had successfully created a good powerpoint on all of the words we needed to know about without copying and pasting.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered this week because when I searched up the word that I had to write a definition about I looked in lots of websites so I knew a lot of information about it and could start to tell if this source of information was reliable or not.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>At the start of the lesson as a team of four we all questioned each other in who was going to find out about this or that word that we were told to do in our task for this lesson that was posted on classroom by Mr Keen but we had to be quick because time was running out.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>In the task we were set for this lesson our team had to negotiate who was doing which word in the list that Mr Keen had sent us on Classroom. Then we decided who was doing what and I was going to be finding about spyware. I was independent because I had to read and find things myself.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I think I gathered good and detailed information about spyware. I typed up my definition of the word in my own words and my team successfully completed their part in the presentation as well. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>At the start of the lesson we were all engaging as a team to what each of us were going to do to make this presentation look good. We were all engaged in our computers and each other and working really hard to get this done because we had a time limit. We had to get this presentation done in 15 seconds.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>My learning could have gone better if I looked in three websites which explained spyware because I only looked at two. This would mean that I would have had more options of information to choose from. I could have focused on my work more so I could get it done quicker and be more efficient.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The changes that I need to make to improve my learning next week are that I need to improve the quickness of my typing. In the lesson I also could have looked at more websites explaining what spyware is.</td>
