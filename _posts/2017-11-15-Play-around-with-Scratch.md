<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Our first task this lesson was to sign into Scratch which was now becoming more and more familiar to me. I am also now remembering my passwords to get into my account.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>On Scratch my target for this lesson was to create some good commands for my sprites in the game I am making (Space Invaders).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes because I made my sprite move around in all directions and my backdrop works when I tell it to as well.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>In Mr Keen's lesson I persevered to make my sprite which is the rocket move around by coding commands for it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned people if they had made the alien boss move left and right to give an idea if I needed to speed up a bit.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>When I was working on my game I tried everything I could before asking Mr Keen for help.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I thought I did well in the lesson and focused hard on what I was trying to overcome.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I always look at what the teacher is doing on his computer because most of the things he is showing us is going to be useful either now or in the future.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have worked harder by typing faster and creating more code. I should have thought about how to make the rocket smaller because otherwise it wouldn’t look right.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>When making the rocket I could have been more creative and made it my own so that it wouldn’t look like everyone else’s. I need to put my folders for other subjects, and DCGS diary under my chair so I have more space to work in which will feel a lot better.</td>
