  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>When our class had all said good afternoon to Mr Keen he sat us all down and introduced us to a new coding website which was a bit like Scratch but more addictive. He told us to click the button called Maze and you had to complete these levels going up to ten but the more levels you do the harder it gets  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Our target for this lesson was to get through all ten questions on Maze using our knowledge and determination. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>In class I worked on the questions really hard and got through all nine but I couldn't do the tenth question even though I tried most of the combinations that I thought would work.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I was a bit frustrated that I couldn't do it so I persevered and had a go at home. After ten minutes I got annoyed and started to think that I was never going to do it but soon I tried to be positive and then I did it. Finally after all that time I had been struggling it had paid off.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I had questioned people if they had done Blocky Games before so I knew it just wasn’t me. I questioned classmates if they could give me a little hint of how to do it if they had already done it but I wouldn’t copy their code I would just try lots of methods myself.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>In every lesson of Computer Science I always try really hard to do things myself because that is the best way to learn stuff, not to copy someone else.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I thought I had a really good go in this lesson programing in Blockly Games and had tried my best to figure out which codes would make certain things either change colour or move into a different direction. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I listened well in class and was very focused when trying to achieve the task that was given to me, for example like finishing a whole section before the end of the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>When we were working out how to make and change certain things to make the little character move I could have had more perseverance because sometimes I would feel a bit down that I hadn’t finished the level in five tries.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time the class  work on Blockly Games I am going to be more positive about doing them and feel more relaxed in where I am compared to the class because lots of people in my class have worked on websites such as this and have more experience. But I will always try my best.</td>
