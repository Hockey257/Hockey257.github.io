  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We came in and logged into our Github account ready to start the lesson. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Our target was to think about how we are going to make the game for example what variables do we need and custom blocks to make our own game. We had to plan and get some ideas down on google docs.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes because I have got some good description of my game onto paper.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I have persevered because I looked on youtube to try and know what a custom block is.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned myself if I could make my game have more than two cars going round the track.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I was independent because I used useful resources, not asking for help where to find what a custom block is.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I am reflecting to my decisions that I could have been a bit quicker login out that lesson because then I wouldn't have missed the bus.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I looked at my computer not at anyone else's so I could not be distracted easily.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In my learning I could have made my planning a bit more detailed in the custom block bit and broadcast. My game could be a bit more complicated giving me an even bigger challenge to work with.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could change my approach to the work we could do in class because normally I feel like I am going to get most things wrong when everyone else gets it. So this could result in me being more possitive.</td>
