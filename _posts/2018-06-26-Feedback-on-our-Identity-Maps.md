<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>In the lesson I started off by sitting round Mr keen who was sitting at his desk. He then told the class that we had to create a google docs presentation of our identity maps that we had made for last weeks homework. Then my classmates would comment on what they liked about my identity map and what they didn't like about it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Our target was to get as many comments on our identity maps as possible written down on our presentation. We would then look at all the different comments that people had said. This can help us understand that not all people are going to comment and say something nice.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes I did reach my target, because I had had a good, lengthy piece of writing that my peers had wrote about my identity map. I also got a better understanding of who social media works and how people can get bullied.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>This week I persevered a lot because even though I didn't really want to comment on nearly half of the classe’s pieces of work I tried my best to give them honest and nice feedback.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I didn’t question a lot today because I was focusing hard on trying to write good and bad comment for other people's work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>In this lesson I had to be very independant because the classroom was very quiet and everyone else was getting on with their work. I was independant by being quiet and focusing on my work. I also made sure that I gave good feedback to the person I was writing my comment to so that he knew what he could improve. I was very independant because I didn’t want to distract others.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I think that lesson I tried really hard to give good feedback to people so that it could help them improve. When I looked at my presentation after nearly everyone in my class had wrote comments, it was a page and a bit full of feedback. Some of it was good and some of it was bad- mostly good. Someone had wrote about Liverpool FC being really rubbish and other people said more silly comments that were irrelevant. This taught me that on social media people can be nasty and not everyone is nice.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I didn’t engage that much with Mr Keen that much except from at the start of the lesson because our task was to be quiet and get on with writing our comments of other people’s work. However I did engage with my computer a lot of the time because most of the lesson we were typing.</td>

    <td>The thing that could have gone better in my learning this week would be my questioning and engagement with the teacher.</td>

    <td>In my learning I could have tried to ask or answer a couple of useful questions to help me be more inquisitive.</td>
