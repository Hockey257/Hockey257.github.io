    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Sign into Scratch and make sure we listen to what Mr Keen says because he talked to us about this computer language which computers understand.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Our class's target was to start to finish our games that we have made over the last six weeks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, because I have made most of my game but I just need to have a part were you can choose your car out of the three available. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered in making all the variables disappear when I started the game because at first it wouldn't go away but then I pieced everything together and it worked.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked Mr Keen how to have a choice of cars because that would make my game more interesting and enticing to play. However, even though I asked Mr Keen for help I knew he wasn’t going to do it for me but just point me in the right direction.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked hard myself when things weren’t going so well, for instance the cars didn’t disappear when I wanted to but then after a few minutes of thinking to myself I found the answer out.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I have reflected in class because I now have made a choice of cars to choose from to challenge myself to get a higher mark in my final piece of work. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I saw at the start of the lesson that Mr Keen was showing how to make levels in your game, even though I didn’t have levels in my game I just watched and listened.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have not got distracted by Mr Keen who was kindly helping other people in how to make levels for their game when I didn’t need levels but to just crack on with what I was doing.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to change the efficiency of my typing, it could be a little quicker. I could have music in my game because in my plan I said I would have it playing in the background but I’ll have to do more research in how to get music playing while you are playing games on Scratch. </td>
